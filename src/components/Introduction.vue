    <p>I am a driven and versatile web developer with a
      passion for problem
      solving. I
      recently graduated from Boise Codeworks, a 12 week coding bootcamp, where I learned the ins and outs of web
      development
      with
      an emphasis on MVC architecture. My commitment to growth is reflected in my continuous pursuit of mastering new
      tools and technologies. I thrive in collaborative environments that encourage innovation and enjoy
      leveraging my analytical mindset to solve new and complex challenges. Whether I am working on front-end interfaces
      or back-end logic, my goal is to create solutions that not only meet objectives but also delight users.</p>
